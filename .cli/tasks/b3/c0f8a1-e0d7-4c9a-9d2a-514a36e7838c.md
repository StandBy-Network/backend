# Bug: change name of the assist in config.

## Description

If the config was changed inmmediately after creation and the some assist
was renamed from default one (in config only) or some additional assist
were added then the following error would be shown for status command:


````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
lua: ...task/status.lua:115: attempt to compare two nil values
stack traceback:
        ...task/status.lua:115: in function
<...task/status.lua:112>
        [C]: in function 'sort'
        ...task/status.lua:112: in function 'status'
        cli/task.lua:12: in function '?'
        task/src/fl.lua:56: in function
<task/src/cli.lua:41>
        (tail call): ?
        [C]: ?
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

## Acceptance criteria

* Differences should be ignored: the assist which are existing in
  both config and filesystem should be taken into account.
* Create task for either implementation reinitialization for assists or
  for initialization with defined config.
