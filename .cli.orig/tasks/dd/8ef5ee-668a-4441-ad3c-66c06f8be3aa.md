# Bug: cli create ignores initial lane.

## Description

If initial lane in the config file differs from "backlog"
then "cli create" ignores that folder and recreates "backlog" one.


## Acceptance criteria

* cli create creates and puts task into the initial folder, not the
  hardcoded "backlog" one.
